# settings-editor

> An editor for settings in JSON format

## ‚ùìWhy ?

We use [standard-settings](https://github.com/soixantecircuits/standard-settings) a lot.
Actually we use it in every nodeJS and electron project.

Sometimes, we need a regular human to change the settings in production.  
This an alternative to `ssh` + `vim`

## üåç Installation

`yarn`


## ‚öô Configuration

```
cp settings/settings.default.json settings/settings.json
```

And edit settings.json,  
change the `filepath` value to a path of a settings file that you want
to be available for web editing.


You can also change settings with argv parameters.
Learn more about this on [standard-settings](https://github.com/soixantecircuits/standard-settings)




## üëã Usage

```
yarn run dev
```

### settings-bro

By default, settings-editor will send settings on spacebro. If you want
to work locally, meaning that you will run this application as an app on
the same computer as the file you want to edit, skip to next section.

To use this app to edit file on another computer, run [settings-bro](https://github.com/soixantecircuits/settings-bro) on the computer where you want to edit a settings file.
Edit settings-bro settings file and change attribute `folder.settings`
to the folder that contains the file to be edited.

### save file locally

Edit `settings.settings.json` and change `useSpacebro` to `false`.
The app will read and write directly on local disk.
